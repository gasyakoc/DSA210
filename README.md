Perfect Sleep Routine

Project Purpose

The aim of this project is to investigate the common assumptions that affect sleep quality by analyzing my daily habits. By this analysis, I will try to find habits and patterns that significantly improve sleep quality. The final goal is to design a personalized "Perfect Sleep Routine".

Dataset Description

I have tracked over a two-month period many daily habits that may influence sleep quality. The dataset encompasses a range of variables including numerical, categorical, and time-based information. It was painstakingly recorded in order to make sure that the analysis based on this dataset is valid and reliable.

Project Plan

Data Collection: Two months of recording daily habits

Exploratory Data Analysis: Finding the pattern/relationship between habits and sleep quality.

Feature Engineering: Prepare the data for modeling by creating relevant features.

Modeling:
Test the hypotheses using statistical methods and machine learning techniques.
Assess the effect of habits to improve the quality of sleep.
Findings and Recommendations:
Summarize the findings.
Create a personalized sleep routine based on findings.
Future Work
Improve accuracy of analysis with longer-term data collection.
Experiment with more variables introduced such as stress level, diet, etc.

Tools and Techniques

Python: Data pre-processing, analysis, and visualization.

Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

GitHub is used for version control and the publication of results.

Motivation

Sleep quality understanding and improvement is so important in the context of maintaining mental and physical health. Hence, the project may assist not only in personal outcome improvements but also present some recommendations to everybody willing to optimize sleep by picking up effective habits.




Perfect Sleep Routine

Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to analyze the effects of daily habits on sleep quality. It aims to determine the factors that increase or decrease sleep quality through the collected data and to optimize individual sleep patterns.

Data Set

Source:

The data set was created by tracking individual daily habits. Data was recorded regularly for two months.

Scope:

The data set contains 40 daily records and a total of 18 features.


Project Plan

Data Collection and Cleaning:

Incomplete and Inconsistent Data cleaned.

Numerical and categorical variables were converted to appropriate formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations were made on target variables such as sleep quality, time to fall asleep and stress level.

Relationships between categorical and numerical variables were examined.

Detailed Analysis and Modeling:

Visualization was made with scatter plot, boxplot and violin plot.

Factors affecting sleep quality were determined with regression analysis.

Results and Recommendations:

Recommendations were developed by interpreting the findings.

Tools and Technologies Used

Python:

Data analysis and modeling.

Pandas, NumPy: Data processing.

Matplotlib, Seaborn: Visualization.

Statsmodels: Regression analysis.

Jupyter Notebook:

Code viewing and analysis environment.

Findings Obtained

Factors Affecting Sleep Quality:

Longer sleep durations increase sleep quality.

Activities performed after waking up have a significant effect on sleep quality.

Stress Level:

Spending time with friends reduces stress levels.

The habit of staying away from blue light positively affects sleep quality.

Time to Fall Asleep:

More sleep interruptions increase the time to fall asleep.

Energy Level:

Higher quality sleep and longer sleep durations are associated with higher energy levels.

Project Limitations and Future Work

Limitations:

Data was collected individually and may not be sufficient to make generalizations.

Long-term effects could not be observed because it covered a short time period.

Future Work:

Generalize the analyses with a larger and more diverse data set.

Develop predictive models with machine learning algorithms.
