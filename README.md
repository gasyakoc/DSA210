## Perfect Sleep Routine

### Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to analyze the effects of daily habits on sleep quality. It aims to determine the factors that increase or decrease sleep quality through the collected data and to optimize individual sleep patterns.

### Data Set

Source:
The data set was created by tracking individual daily habits. Data was recorded regularly for two months.

Scope:
The data set contains 40 daily records and a total of 18 features.

### Project Plan

Data Collection and Cleaning:
Incomplete and Inconsistent Data cleaned. Numerical and categorical variables were converted to appropriate formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizations were made on target variables such as sleep quality, time to fall asleep and stress level. Relationships between categorical and numerical variables were examined.

Detailed Analysis and Modeling:
Visualization was made with scatter plot, boxplot and violin plot. Factors affecting sleep quality were determined with regression analysis.

Results and Recommendations:
Recommendations were developed by interpreting the findings.

### Tools and Technologies Used

Python:
Data analysis and modeling.

Pandas, NumPy: Data processing.

Matplotlib, Seaborn: Visualization.

Statsmodels: Regression analysis.

Jupyter Notebook:
Code viewing and analysis environment.

### Findings Obtained

Factors Affecting Sleep Quality:
Longer sleep durations increase sleep quality. Activities performed after waking up have a significant effect on sleep quality.

Stress Level:
Spending time with friends reduces stress levels. The habit of staying away from blue light positively affects sleep quality.

Time to Fall Asleep:
More sleep interruptions increase the time to fall asleep.

Energy Level:
Higher quality sleep and longer sleep durations are associated with higher energy levels.

### Project Limitations and Future Work

Limitations:
Data was collected individually and may not be sufficient to make generalizations. Long-term effects could not be observed because it covered a short time period.

Future Work:
Generalize the analyses with a larger and more diverse data set. Develop predictive models with machine learning algorithms.
