The aim of this project is to analyze popular and less-known hypotheses about sleep quality by collecting data on my daily habits. The plan is to identify habits that improve my sleep quality and use the findings to create “My Perfect Sleep Routine.”

The dataset consists of 2 months of data on my daily habits that might affect sleep quality. Variables include numerical data such as bedtime, wake-up time, total sleep duration, exercise time, steps taken, and screen time. Some of this data was recorded manually, while other metrics were collected from the iPhone step counter and Apple Screen Time.

Additionally, some variables are categorical, with most of these converted into numerical data for analysis
