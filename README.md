The aim of this project is analyzing the popular and unpopular hypotheses about sleep quality by collecting data on my daily habits. The plan is to identify habits that improve my sleep quality and with the findings creating “My Perfect Sleep Routine”

My dataset consists of 2-months of data about my daily habits that might be affect sleep quality. Variables are collected as a form of different type of data. “Bedtime”, “wake-up time”, “total sleep duration”, “exercise time”, “steps taken”, “screen time” are numerical datas which some of them recorded by manulally, while some of them collected from iPhone Step Counter and Apple Screen Time Data. 

Additionally some variables are catagorical like, “The first thing that I do after waking up”,  “activity before bed”, “nutrition before sleep”, “sunlight exposure” etc. Which most of these variable converted into numerical data for analysis.
